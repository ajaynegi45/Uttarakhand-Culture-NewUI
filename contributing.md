# Contributing to the Uttarakhand Culture 🏔️✨

## Introduction and Purpose 🌟

Welcome to the **Uttarakhand Culture Project**! This platform is dedicated to preserving and celebrating the rich cultural heritage of Uttarakhand. We aim to address the growing concern of the younger generation losing touch with their cultural roots by safeguarding the traditional rituals, deities, and unique practices of Uttarakhand. Together, we can ensure this cultural treasure is passed down to future generations. 🌿

Whether you're a coder or a cultural enthusiast, **we need your help**! Your contributions—big or small—are invaluable in building this platform. Let’s work together to bridge the gap and keep our heritage alive! 🌱✨

If you have any questions, doubts, or suggestions about contributing (or anything else), feel free to ping me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ajaynegi45/) or [Twitter](https://x.com/ajaynegi45) anytime. I'll do my best to reply as quickly as possible. 

We're all about **quality over quantity** here, so even your smallest, meaningful contribution will make a bigger impact than something large but less thoughtful. Let's create something special together! 🙌

## How You Can Contribute 👀

You can get involved in **code** or **non-code** contributions. Here’s how:

## For Code Contributions 💻

- **🐞 Found a Bug?**  
  Open an issue with details or, even better, submit a pull request with the fix.
  
- **🎉 Got a Feature Idea?**  
  Share your feature ideas in an issue to discuss or go ahead and submit a pull request implementing the feature!

- **💅 Want to Improve the User Interface?**  
  If you have design skills or ideas, we welcome UI improvements! Propose changes in layout, color scheme, or fonts—just remember, we love **minimal and clean designs**.

- **💻 Building the Platform?**  
  We’re using **Nextjs with TypeScript for the frontend** and the backend**. If you have expertise in these technologies, your contributions are highly appreciated. Need help getting started? Just reach out!

## For Non-Code Contributions 📄

You don’t need to be a developer to contribute! Here's how you can help:

- **Improve Documentation**  
  Help us write or refine our documentation, making it easier for others to join the project.

- **Contribute to Website Design**  
  Your creativity is welcome! Share design suggestions to improve the website’s aesthetic.

  <a href="https://ajaynegi.notion.site/Resources-f92bcb910d0544a1a8db50cc3ef79cfe" target="_blank">Explore this resource also for gathering cultural information</a>

- **Suggest a Name for the Website**  
  We're still on the hunt for the perfect name! We want something meaningful in the local language that reflects the website's mission. Got an idea? Share it via opening an [issue](https://github.com/ajaynegi45/Uttarakhand-Culture-NewUI/issues/new?assignees=&labels=status%3A+awaiting+triage&projects=&template=feature_request.yml&title=%5BFEATURE%5D+%3Cbrief+description%3E) or **[Email](mailto:codiescoder@gmail.com)** with the subject line “Website Name Suggestion.” Your creativity could name this entire project!

> **Contributor Spotlight:** We value every contribution! To celebrate your efforts, we'll feature your name and photo on a dedicated "Contributors" page, where you'll receive full recognition for your impact on this project. Your contributions will help us preserve Uttarakhand's rich culture, and we're excited to share your work with the world!

# Good Coding Practices 🧑‍💻

1. **Follow the Project's Code Style**

   - Maintain consistency with the existing code style (indentation, spacing, comments).
   - Use meaningful and descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes.
   - Keep functions short and focused on a single task.
   - Avoid hardcoding values; instead, use constants or configuration files when possible.

2. **Write Clear and Concise Comments**

   - Use comments to explain why you did something, not just what you did.
   - Avoid unnecessary comments that state the obvious.
   - Document complex logic and functions with brief explanations to help others understand your thought -process.

3. **Keep Code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**

   - Avoid duplicating code. Reuse functions, methods, and components whenever possible.
   - If you find yourself copying and pasting code, consider creating a new function or component.

4. **Write Tests**

   - Write unit tests for your functions and components.
   - Ensure your tests cover both expected outcomes and edge cases.
   - Run tests locally before making a pull request to make sure your changes don’t introduce new bugs.

5. **Code Reviews and Feedback**

   - Be open to receiving constructive feedback from other contributors.
   - Conduct code reviews for others and provide meaningful suggestions to improve the code.
   - Always refactor your code based on feedback to meet the project's standards.
