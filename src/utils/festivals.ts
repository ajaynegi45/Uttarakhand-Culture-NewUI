According to local belief, Lord Rama returned from exile late to these areas, which is why people here celebrate Egaas with great enthusiasm. The festival involves preparing traditional delicacies, performing joyful folk dances, and lighting up homes, much like Diwali. A standout tradition is spinning a flaming rope called \"Bhailo\", where villagers twirl a fire-lit rope, creating a mesmerizing display symbolizing light’s triumph over darkness. Egaas Bagwal reflects Uttarakhand’s rich cultural heritage, offering a glimpse into the community’s deep-rooted traditions and festive spirit. For the people of Uttarakhand, it’s not just a festival, but a meaningful tribute to their ancestors and the vibrant life of the hills."},

In Uttarakhand, it is celebrated with great joy and enthusiasm, especially in the hill areas. People gather in open fields to fly kites, symbolizing the victory of light over darkness. Bonfires are lit, and people prepare traditional sweets like tilgul (made of sesame and jaggery) to share with friends and family. The festival also has agricultural importance, marking the end of winter and the beginning of the harvest season. Devotees take a holy dip in the Ganges or other rivers, believing it cleanses their sins. It’s a time for prayers for a good harvest, prosperity, and happiness in the coming year. People also worship the Sun God for health and well-being." ,

It is the time when flowers blossom and this is accompanied by the ceremonial pudding called dei which is made by the locals using jaggery or gud, curd and flour. This dish is an integral part of the festival. Young girls are an integral part of this festival of Uttarakhand. They go from house to house, singing the folk song of 'Phool Dei' with jaggery, rice, and coconut offering. It is believed that they bless the homes by placing flowers and rice on the doorsteps. In return, the young girls are offered sweets and blessings for their act." ,

Harela is a festival that marks the beginning of the rainy season or monsoon. The people belonging to the Kumaon community celebrate this festival during the month of Shravana, i.e., July-August. Mythologically, this festival commemorates the wedding of Lord Shiva and Parvati. People make small idols or dikars of gods like Maheshwar, Ganesh. This festival is followed by Bhitauli, which is celebrated in the month of Chaitra, i.e., March - April. It revolves around agriculture where women sow seeds in the soil and by the end of the festival they reap the harvest which is called harela. This allows them to test the quality of their seeds. During this festival, brothers also provide gifts for their sisters.",

It is also known as the 'Olgia' festival and is celebrated on the first day of August (Bhado), a time wherein the crops are thriving, and the milk-laden cattle are ready to be milked. In terms of how the celebration has gradually evolved from over the years, the ancient tradition saw nephews and sons-in-laws give presents to their maternal uncles and fathers-in-laws respectively. However, today's context is summarised by the fact that agriculturists and artisans give presents to their landowners. Common presents that are exchanged include axes, ghee, datkhocha (metallic toothpick) and firewood. An important ritual of this festival includes that of eating ghee and chapatis stuffed with urad dal!",
