In the lower elevations, tropical and sub-tropical regions are dominated by Sal, Teak, and Bamboo forests. As altitude increases, temperate zones feature Oak, Rhododendron, and Deodar trees, with Rhododendron being culturally significant. The alpine region, above 3,000 meters, is known for its vibrant Bugyals (meadows) filled with seasonal wildflowers like Brahma Kamal and Blue Poppy. The state is also rich in medicinal plants such as Ashwagandha and Giloy, which are integral to traditional Ayurvedic medicine. Uttarakhand's flora is crucial for the local ecosystem, culture, and economy.",
