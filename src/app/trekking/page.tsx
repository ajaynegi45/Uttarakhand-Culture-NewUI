						"Roopkund, perhaps the most popular trek in India, is almost picture-perfect. The Roopkund trail climbs out of splendid dark forests suddenly bursting into Ali and Bedni Bugyal, arguably India’s most beautiful high altitude meadows. Out of the meadows, the trail quickly gets into terrific alpine stretches.\n" +
						"Climbing on snow to the Roopkund lake is a heart-pounding thrill. The beautiful Mt Trishul looms over the setting getting closer as you climb higher when at a ridge above Roopkund, only air separates the trekker from them and Trishul."
