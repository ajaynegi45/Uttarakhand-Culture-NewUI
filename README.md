### **Problem**
🔍 A concerning trend is emerging in Uttarakhand:
- The younger generation is gradually forgetting their cultural heritage and traditional rituals.
- Each successive generation possesses less cultural knowledge than the previous one. For instance:
  - **Grandparents** hold significantly more cultural knowledge than their children.
  - **Today's youth** are likely to have even less cultural understanding than their parents.
  
If this trend continues, Uttarakhand's cultural heritage risks disappearing, erasing the region's identity and depriving future generations of their cultural roots.
